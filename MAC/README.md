BASH ENVIRONMENT
----------------

This includes my custom setup for JANUS, VIM, TMUX.
BASH Scripts will be comming up 

For MAC Users : you require ITERM2
ITERM2 needs proper configuration for ASCII Symbols 

The script requires a Bash Environment Variable set to a Temp Directory
To enable the script you need --> chmod +x

I would recommend looking at the aliases !!!

[BREW](https://brew.sh/) is needed in order to run this script

Special Thanks to Neel Shah
