This is Sebastian Velasquez-Foubert (aka goku2696) 
BASH ENVIRONMENT

This includes my custom setup for JANUS, VIM, TMUX.
BASH Scripts will be comming up 

For MAC Users : you require ITERM2
Linux / Fedora Users : Update Soon

The script requires a Bash Environment Variable set to a Temp Directory
To enable the script you need --> chmod +x

I would recommend looking at the aliases !!!

BREW is needed in order to run this script

Special Thanks to Neel Shah
