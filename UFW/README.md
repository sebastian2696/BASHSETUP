BASH ENVIRONMENT
----------------

This includes my custom setup for JANUS, VIM, TMUX.
BASH Scripts for Windows 

For Windows Users : I suggest using [HyperTerminal](https://hyper.is/)

The script requires a Bash Environment Variable set to a Temp Directory
To enable the script you need --> chmod +x

I would recommend looking at the aliases !!!

In order to use powerline fonts I recommend following this
[guide](https://medium.com/@jrcharney/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-the-almost-complete-set-up-1dd3cb89b794)
It will require some messing around with powershell 

If you do run HyperTerminal, I recomment reading
[this](https://evdokimovm.github.io/windows/zsh/shell/syntax/highlighting/ohmyzsh/hyper/terminal/2017/02/24/how-to-install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10.html)
